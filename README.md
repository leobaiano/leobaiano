## Me in everyday life

I like making friends and getting to know new cultures, I believe this broadens my horizons and makes me see the world in a more fun way. I'm not the type who enjoys staying at home, I like going out, talking to friends, listening to good live music, drinking some cold beers and going to the beach.

When I'm at home I like to watch series and relax.

I don't have a favorite style of music, for me the environment, company and my state of mind at the moment define the type of music I like at that time. Currently I haven't played sports but I've played a lot of football, I like to walk in the morning to take care of my health.

This is me, if you want to get to know me better just call me, I'd love to.
